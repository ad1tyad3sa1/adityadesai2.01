## Looks for the Future:

- Start off this project well, compared to last Trimester, focus more on organization of data rather than a pretty picture website. 

- I am passionate about creating a program set in a game development environment based on the backend and frontend requirements.

- I plan to implement my understanding of binary, crowdsourcing, and other applicable topics into my CPT project so it appeals to CSP teachers.

- Building on my Javascript and Python skills while working on the project, creating more clear and concise code that others can understand easily.
