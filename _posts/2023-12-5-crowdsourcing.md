# Crowdsourcing

## Key Takeaways:

- Crowdsourcing involves obtaining information, ideas, services, or content from a large group of people, often from an online community, instead of traditional employees or suppliers.

- Leverages the collective intelligence and skills of a diverse crowd to solve problems, generate ideas, and complete tasks.

## Popcorn Hack #1

- Public Datasets:

Platforms like Kaggle, Google Public Datasets, and Data.gov provide courses, competitions, and resources for visualization, TensorFlow AI, machine learning, and more.
Widespread access to public datasets enables problem identification, solution development, and results dissemination.


## Popcorn Hack #2

- Distributed Computing:

Involves donating spare computing power to support various applications.
Example: BOINC at the University of California Berkeley, which applies distributed computing to projects in mathematics, astrophysics, climate research, and even Minecraft's map development.
Innovations with Crowdsourcing

- Spotify:

Utilizes crowdsourced data for collaborative playlists, algorithm training, and metadata enhancement.

- Crowdfunding:

Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo enable individuals to pitch ideas for others to invest in.
Blockchain:

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, leverage external computing power through a process called "mining" for transaction processing.

- Concert Tickets:

Crowdsourcing contributes to innovations in ticketing, improving accessibility and distribution.

- Overall Understanding:

Crowdsourcing is a versatile method driving innovations across various sectors, from music streaming services like Spotify to financial platforms like Kickstarter and emerging technologies like blockchain. It relies on the collective power of a diverse crowd to enhance problem-solving and idea generation. Public datasets and distributed computing further amplify the potential of crowdsourcing by providing accessible resources and computing power.
