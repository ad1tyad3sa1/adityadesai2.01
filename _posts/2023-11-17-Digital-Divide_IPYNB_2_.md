## Digital Divide

The digital divide is the gap between those who have access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) resources, such as the internet and digital devices, and those who do not.

---

## Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.
(IOC-1.C.1 + IOC-1.C.2)

* Socioeconomic Variation: Access to the Internet is not uniform across economic status groups. Individuals with higher socioeconomic status may have better access to the internet compared to others.

* Demographic Variation: Internet access can differ based on demographic factors such as age, education level, and occupation. Younger, more educated individuals might have better or easier access compared to older individuals or those with a lower education.

* International Disparities: Developed nations often have widespread internet infrastructure compared to developing or underdeveloped countries. Countries with mountainous or other rough terrain might have difficulties providing internet. Additionally, urban areas generally have better internet infrastructure than rural areas. Remote or underdeveloped regions may face challenges in accessing the internet.

How might age, education level, or occupation affect someone's ability to access the internet?

**Age, education level, and occupation can impact internet access. Older individuals may struggle due to lower digital literacy and potential physical limitations. Higher education levels often correlate with better digital skills and awareness of the internet's benefits. Certain occupations, particularly those requiring digital tasks, may enhance access, while income levels play a role in affording internet services. Geographic location matters, with urban areas usually having better infrastructure. Government policies and initiatives also influence accessibility, with proactive measures contributing to more equitable internet access. Bridging the digital divide involves addressing these factors through efforts in digital literacy, infrastructure improvement, and economic inclusivity.**

## The digital divide can have a huge impact on society
(IOC-1.C.4)
### Digital divide raises multiple beneficial and detrimental aspects:

* Equity Issues: Due to digital divide, certain groups or individuals may be systematically disadvantaged in terms of opportunities, resources, and benefits derived from digital technologies.

* Access Challenges: Limited access to the internet and digital devices raises concerns about fair and equal opportunities for education, employment, healthcare, and social participation in our modern societies. 

* Influence Considerations: The divide extends beyond mere access, impacting the ability of individuals or groups to influence and engage in the increasingly digital world. As this technology develops more quickly, those without access are left behind faster. Students without internet access fall behind their peers in school. Then, as other students keep learning, it becomes harder and harder to catch up.

Imagine you are an exchange student from another country visiting our community, you have grown up without using the internet and now you go to Del Norte. State 2-3 reasons you might be at a disadvantage to other students your age.

**As an exchange student from a background without internet exposure, I may encounter several disadvantages at Del Norte. Firstly, my peers may possess higher digital literacy, having grown up with easy access to online resources for education and communication. This discrepancy could hinder my ability to keep up with technology-driven academic tasks or collaborative projects. Additionally, social integration might be challenging, as many social interactions and activities are organized or facilitated online among students. Without prior internet experience, I may find it difficult to participate fully in the digital aspects of social life, potentially affecting my overall sense of belonging in the community.**


### The digital divide can be positively and negatively influnced by both individuals and groups.
(IOC-1.C.3 + IOC-1.C.5)

* Group Impact: Entire demographic groups or communities may experience limited access to digital resources, impacting their ability to participate in the digital economy, education, and social activities. This can perpetuate existing inequalities. However, groups can work to bridge the digital divide through humanitarian efforts.

* Individual Effect: Those with limited access to the web may face challenges in acquiring digital skills, accessing information, and participating in online communication, which can hinder personal and professional development. Additionally, the choices individuals make may contribute to the digital divide. Actions such as purchasing digital devices or subscribing to internet services may indirectly be contributing to its growth.

* Organizational and Government Impact: Companies, organizations, and governments play a role in shaping the digital landscape. This includes certain business practices including the deployment of infrastructure and the design of digital products. Government policies or initiatives, including investment in digital infrastructure and literacy programs, have a considerable weight to bridge or exacerbate existing disparities.

Using the provided graphic and what you have just learned, pick one country that is heavily impacted by the digital divide, and give three reasons why that might be.

**India is a country heavily impacted by the digital divide, and several factors contribute to this disparity. First, there is a significant rural-urban gap in internet infrastructure. While urban areas boast better connectivity and access to digital resources, rural regions face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and limited availability of internet services, hindering the overall digital inclusion of rural populations. Second, socioeconomic disparities play a crucial role; a considerable portion of the population, particularly in rural areas, lacks the financial means to afford internet services and necessary devices. This economic barrier further exacerbates the digital divide. Finally, there is a notable discrepancy in digital literacy levels. Despite the increasing availability of technology, a substantial portion of the population, especially in rural and less privileged urban areas, lacks the skills needed to navigate the digital world effectively. These three interrelated factors contribute to the persistent digital divide in India, limiting equal access to the opportunities presented by the digital age.**
